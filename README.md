# bigip-kubernetes-gateway

## Description

Integrating BIG-IP as implementation provider for SIGNetworks gateway.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Build and push your image:
	
```sh
make -C build
```

2. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f deploy
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
kubectl apply -f deploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster
